# Accenture-Forage-Program
Accenture Data Analytics And Visualisation Simulation Programme
During my involvement in the Accenture Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program with Forage, I had the opportunity to contribute as a data analyst for a company called "Social Buzz." My role focused on analyzing their extensive dataset and providing insights on how they could effectively harness the power of their data.

Business Problem: The client has experienced rapid growth in recent years, resulting in a significant increase in their operations. However, they lack the necessary internal resources to manage and handle this scale effectively.

My Job Role: I am the data analyst assigned to analyse the client's sample data sets, generate insights, prepare visualizations and prepare a presentation to the client.

During this experience I have learnt and applied my data analytics skills to:

Project Understanding - Project Requirements and team alignment
Data Cleaning & Data Modelling (Used Microsoft Power BI)
Data Visualization and Storytelling- (Used Power BI )
Presenting Insights back to the client (Microsoft PowerPoint)
